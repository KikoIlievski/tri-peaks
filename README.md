This is a re-creation of the game TriPeaks, from the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. 

This project is special to me, as it was my first ever OOP application. I made this in highschool and am surprised I stumbled my way through to create a working game. The code quailty you'll find in here is an absolute shocker, but we've all been there. You must walk before you can run, even if the walk looks a bit funny.

# Running TriPeaks
Trying to run this will likely not work as back in highschool I had no idea what PIP even really was, let alone pyenv, pipenv, or Pipfile.lock files.

Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/KikoIlievski/tri-peaks`  
Navigate into the directory using `cd tri-peaks`  
Run the game by using the command `python3 "TriPeaks program.py"`
